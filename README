Who the fuck is Bob Wood? (For those who like to read a git log.)

He is Charlie Root's cousin and my secret servant who actually does all
the work for me.

Seriously, it's just a fictional name of a user on internal bsd9 host. 
As I was tired of my usual 'alex' login everywhere, I gitcloned the
central ripo from my workstation and made a branch on bsd9 to do all
'work' with open-vm-tools port there.  And bsd9 in fact contains
FreeBSD 8.2.
